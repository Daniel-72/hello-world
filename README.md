# hello-world
My way into github. Following the Guide, creating a repository and...
...now I am about to commit my first changes to this repository. After having worked more than a decade with software developers, this is the first time for me to actually breach this boundary (embarassing I know). I'm excited about where this may lead me.
After adding a link to Azure DevOps I will now try to link a commit to a specific AzureDevOps work item.
And again: first time didn't work as expected. This time I add the comment Fixes AB#18560 to relate the commit and pull request to the work item.
